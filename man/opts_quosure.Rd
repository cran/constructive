\title{Constructive options for class 'quosure'}
\usage{
opts_quosure(constructor = c("new_quosure", "next", "language"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{constructor}{String. Name of the function used to construct the object, see Details section.}

\item{...}{Additional options used by user defined constructors through the \code{opts} object}
}
\value{
An object of class <constructive_options/constructive_options_quosure>
}
\description{
These options will be used on objects of class 'quosure'.
}
\details{
Depending on \code{constructor}, we construct the object as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{"new_quosure"} (default): Build the object using a \code{new_quosure()} call on a
character vector.
\item \code{"next"} : Use the constructor for the next supported class. Call \code{.class2()}
on the object to see in which order the methods will be tried.
\item \code{"language"} : We define as an language object and repair attributes.
}
}
